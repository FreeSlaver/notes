* 学习方法
  The best way to learn any language, including SQL, is to use it to make progress toward something you care about.

  Unless you somehow think SQL is the most mesmerizing thing in the universe, it's hard to sit down and grok through W3School and its ilk.
  Instead, you should find a problem that interests you that requires some knowledge of SQL.
** 必须找到和其他知识最多连接点的知识。
怎么快速的学习了？我不可能css3的新特性一个个看到，但是我要了解到有些什么东西，能干撒，具体如何干，
   后续遇到我再来查资料。

  MVP这个概念要搞清楚。

minimum viable product

A minimum viable product (MVP) helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning as quickly as possible.
the goal of the MVP is to begin the process of learning, not end it.

Unlike a prototype or concept test, an MVP is designed not just to answer product design or technical questions. Its goal is to test fundamental business hypotheses.
The lesson of the MVP is that any additional work beyond what was required to start learning is waste, no matter how important it might have seemed at the time.
TM的说的太好了。


怎么搞这么一点东西需要搞这么多东西？
如果是PHP怎么搞？真TM蛋疼的很，如果是JS怎么搞？
先搞一个java的，然后搞一个PHP的？

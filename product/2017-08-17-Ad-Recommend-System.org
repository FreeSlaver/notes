  Our ad serving infrastructure determines which ad to serve at what time, and it tracks events like impressions, clicks and engagements.
  There are billions of tracking events per day and since these events are the source of truth for advertising and billing,
  it is critical that they are reliably stored in HDFS for posterity.
